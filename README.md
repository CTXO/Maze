# Maze Game
Project done by me in high school to understand core concepts of programming

## Description
Maze game is a simple game made with python and tkinter with 3 levels with a terminal version and a GUI version.

## Instalation

Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/CTXO/Maze.git`

### Dependencies
- Python 3 

### Linux users
In Linux it is necessary to install **tkinter**

Debian based distros: `sudo apt-get install python3-tk`

RPM based distros: `sudo yum install python3-tkinter`

## How to Play
- Go to the repository folder through the terminal
- Execute the command `python3 mainCMD.py` to play the terminal version or `python3 mainGUI.py` to play the GUI version
- It is strongly recommended to start playing the terminal version, since the last level was designed specifically for it.

## What Did I Learn
- Conditionals
- Loops
- Work with multiple files
- OOP
- Manipulate matrices (lists)
- GUI concepts
- Handle multiple windows
- Event Handling

## What Can Be Improved
- Separate the classes Maze and MazeGUI into different files
- Use a loop to change betweeen levels so it is easier to create more levels in the future (DRY code)
- Develop an interface to create mazes graphically, instead of using strings
